<p>At Taman Jurong, the Senior Citizens' Executive Committee (SCEC) organises
a wide range of activities to empower our seniors to stay active, healthy,
and socially connected. From brisk walks around Singapore to Karaoke sessions,
our SCEC ensures that every senior in the community has opportunities to
engage, make new friends, and keep both body and mind active!</p>
<p>Here are some of the seniors engaging activities this year.</p>
