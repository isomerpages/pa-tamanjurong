<p>Taman Jurong CACC will be hosting PAssionArts Festival 2024. This year,
we willl be celebrating the vibrant and evocative power of food and would
like to invite everyone to channel their artistic creativity through any
medium, infusing art with the essense of food. Explore and express the
deep connections between food and memory, capturing the sentimental and
heartwarming sotreis that food can tell. This festival aims to delve into
the sensory experience that food evokes, engaging sight, sound, smell,
taste and touch. By creating imaginative and diverse expressions, we hope
to inspire the community to reminisce and connect through the rich and
emotioanl significance of food, highlighting its unique and powerful impact
on our lives. Whether through our drop-in booths or our interactive workshops,
we aim for everyone to experience the joy, nostalgia, and inspiration that
food can evoke through arts.</p>
