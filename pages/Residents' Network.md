<p>Residents' Networks (RNs) are important grassroots organisations that
enhance community spirit in our neighbourhoods. Their primary goals are
to foster neighbourliness, promote community bonding, and improve residents'
quality of life. RNs achieve these objectives by organising a wide range
of activities such as block parties, various classes, and festive celebrations,
creating opportunities for neighbours to interact and build relationships.
RNs work closely with other grassroots organisations and government agencies,
serving as a crucial link to channel residents' feedback and suggestions.
By encouraging active participation in community events and facilitating
open communication, RNs contribute significantly to creating harmonious,
resilient, and cohesive community. Through their tireless efforts, RNs
ensure that each neighbourhood within their zone becomes a vibrant, connected
community where residents feel a strong sense of belonging and actively
look out for one another.</p>
